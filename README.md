> *45gfg9's Minecraft Blog ParSer*

Yet another Minecraft blog parser.

**This is an experimental project.**

## Usage & Note

Currently, PHP 8.0 is required. (yes, for that syntax sugar)

To use 4Mbps on macOS / Linux, `git clone` this repository and `cd`.
Run `php -S localhost:8080`, or use your preferred PHP server.

To use 4Mbps on Windows, please figure it out by yourself.
